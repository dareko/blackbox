# Getting Started

Calls to @bx always accept two arguments, first being one of embedded query name, table/view or custom query. Second a grep expression, direct ID or custom query.

Both arguments must be provided at all times:
    @bx sql;n=10 ;active

Should any of the arguments contain spaces, wrap the whole one within double quotes:
    @bx "sql;w=sql_text like '%hr.emp%'" .

Remember that beyond what you see, each report is a grid with semi-colon as column seperator, so you can easily match beginning and end of columns with it. Just make sure you double last semi-colon if at argument's end (SQL*Plus eats last one):
    @bx ses ;active
    @bx usr sys;;

Blackbox always matches all columns using regular expression. Call below will list match all services with "oltp" somewhere in their name. Case is meaningless here:
    @bx svc oLtP

First argument can be embedded query, arbitrary table or just any select. Just remember that built-in queries are the best, have unified units and most accurate choice of columns:
    @bx ses .
    @bx gv$session .
    @bx "select * from gv$session" .

Similarly, second argument can be a filter, a list of IDs or a select (IDs are defined only within embedded queries as ID_ columns). To negate grep value (-v) just prefix the filter with exclamation mark (!). Your own session is aliased with ~. See below:
    @bx ses inactive
    @bx ses =285,364,1218
    @bx ses !background
    @bx ses ~
    @bx ses "select sid from v$mystat"

You can quickly browse through the list of embedded reports with DEF, it will show Blackbox queries as "not implemented":
SQL> def
DEFINE AAS = not implemented (BUFFER)
...
